        <h2>LovRub&#8482 For Women</h2>
        <p>LovRub&#8482 feminine arousal gel is topically applied. The gentle application of LovRub&#8482 
           with Aloe Vera becomes a natural part of foreplay that actively contributes to female 
           sexual pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>The exclusive blend of all-natural herbs and extracts in LovRub&#8482 naturally stimulates 
           the body&#39s own sensory nerve conduction, heightening sexual sensation and pleasure.</p>
        <p>Squeeze a few drops of LovRub&#8482 from the tube and apply with tender massage to the clitoris, 
           underneath the clitoral hood, labia, and vaginal opening for five minutes prior to intercourse.</p>
        <p>From the very first use, LovRub&#39s&#8482 unique effects tend to pleasantly surprise most women. 
           Since you are in complete control of your desired intensity, women wishing to enjoy more 
           intensely pleasurable sensations can simply use more LovRub&#8482 per each sexual encounter. 
           Use the amount that suits you best.</p>
        <p>For best effects&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.don&#39t rush. During foreplay, you and your partner should gradually apply 
           the gel with gentle massage onto the clitoris. Massage in tenderly. The effects generally 
           begin in about four-to-five minutes, with a feeling of genital warming that will build to 
           a pleasurable level and plateau within about 10 minutes. You may also experience heightened 
           genital sensation to touch and/or sexual intercourse, heightened arousal, and increased 
           sexual pleasure. The effects generally last 30-45 minutes with a single application. Repeat 
           as often as desired. To remove, simply wash off. Many women report that when using LovRub&#8482 
           during intercourse, their male partner also experiences greater sexual satisfaction.</p>
        <h2>LovRub&#8482 For Men</h2>
        <p>LovRub&#8482 male enhancement gel is topically applied. This unique formulation is made with 
           Aloe Vera and also includes L-Arginine. Aloe Vera is well known to revitalize skin in the 
           area most involved in arousal. LovRub&#8482 improves one&#39s level of desire, satisfaction with 
           level of sexual arousal, genital sensation, and sexual pleasure.</p>
        <p>The gentle application of LovRub&#8482 with Aloe Vera will become a natural part of foreplay 
           that actively contributes to male sexual pleasure, stimulation, and satisfaction.</p>
        <p>The exclusive blend of all-natural herbs and extracts in LovRub&#8482 naturally stimulates 
           the body&#39s own sensory nerve conduction, heightening sexual sensation and pleasure. 
           You will see and feel a difference instantly, starting with the very first application, 
           and be amazed at how LovRub&#8482 maximizes pleasure, making every sexual experience stronger.</p>
        <p>For best effects&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.don&#39t rush. You and your partner should gradually apply the LovRub&#8482 gel 
           with gentle massage. The physiology of the male erectile tissue provides numerous points 
           of interaction in which stimulation may be used to overcome a decline in erectile 
           responsiveness. LovRub&#8482 is aimed at taking advantage of enhancing stimulation regularly 
           through use of targeted topical delivery. Massage it tenderly in the area most involved 
           in arousal. The effect generally begins immediately with a feeling of warming that will 
           build to a pleasurable level and plateau within about five to ten minutes. You will feel 
           heightened arousal and increased sexual pleasure. The effect will generally last 30-45 
           minutes with a single application. Repeat as often as desired. To remove, simply wash 
           off with water.</p>
